Install
--------

### Vagrant

1. Install Virtualbox
2. Install Vagrant
3. Install ansible (probably via pip: sudo pip install ansible)
4. Run:

    ./ansible/build-local


### Local

This method will require a whole bunch of local libraries and build deps
that I'm not gonna walk you through. If you want to go down this path, I
assume you already know your way around developing Django apps and have
all the requisite tools installed.

1. ./install
2. ./run
